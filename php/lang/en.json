    "bod1":"This initiative started when one of the founders, Anibal Damiao got in touch. We diverted some efforts of our team, that was working on some secret projects, and we launched the campaign in 10 days.<br><br>We basically turned our company around to onboard 30/40 more employees quickly.",
    "hed2":"Anibal Damiao",
    "sub2":"is 43 so he had enough of a life to see first hand how people, even in Denmark, dehumanized refuges from Syria a few years ago. Anibal also had the chance to see how national and EU governments didn’t stop the war in Syria and Ukraine when they could.",
    "bod2":["Those humans had a different value. And he also had the chance to see how the EU mostly ignored the 2014 invasion of Ukraine while weakening everyone with bad environmental, foreign relations and energetic policies, allowing the bad guys in Russia to believe that they can continue untouched. It’s not a democracy when these things happen, when oligarchs are welcome in dafe and fancy neighbors, when politicians take board roles in companies supported by the regime, etc.. Every single politician in the EU and at the government level is co-responsible for lack of action that enabled wars. As a private citizen, Anibal doesn’t understand how EU politicians can justify their salaries if EU’s energetic dependency on Russia and economic dependency on others was allowed to happen. And our partners can’t understand it either.",
            "Although Denmark isn’t the worst on that list of countries, Anibal was (and still is) a foreigner in this country thatallowed some to spit on Syrian refugees walking in a highway towards safely, a country that had an election moving towards syrian refugees as it single issue, and a country that had a long government-led hate speech towards refugees.A country that ultimately sent an immigration minister to jail due to her outrageous and illegal behavior is a country that doesn’t have a short term view of peace in the world.<br><br>Denmark is not the worst though, Danes are mostly not like that. Anibal Damiao believes that the our society can still do more, along what local governments are doing."],
